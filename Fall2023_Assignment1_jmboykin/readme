Overview
Create a webpage to showcase a movie or TV show you like.
Setup
Create a public GitHub repository and add the project to the repository.
Using Visual Studio 2022, create a new project of type "ASP.NET Core Web App".
Name the project SemesterYear-Assignment1-YourMyBamaUsername (example: Fall2023-Assignment1-mdmay1)
Select Target Framework as the latest version.
Open the Program.cs file in your project.
Add in the line app.UseDefaultFiles(); BEFORE the line app.UseStaticFiles(); as seen below:
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseDefaultFiles();
app.UseStaticFiles();
NOTE: The above steps 5 & 6 are a hack to dumb-down Visual Studio to just handle HTML files. Later in the semester we won't have to do this sort of things as we will use the full power of VS.
Add a new HTML page called index.html to the wwwroot folder (Right click wwwroot folder -> Add -> New Item... -> HTML Page) and add the HTML/CSS below to that file.
Requirements
Find a movie or TV series that you are a fan of and employ the following HTML/CSS features:
A background color for the entire page of your choosing.
A div containing:
An h1 element with an ID of "Title".
An img element related to the media with and ID of 'CoverArt' (Cover art is good here). This image should be circular/have rounded edges.
An h5 element with an ID of 'Rating'. This should be the rating from IMDB out of 10.
An iframe embedding a youtube video of a trailer of the media with an ID of "Trailer". This can be acquired by right clicking on the video, and copying the embed.
An <a> element linking to the IMDB page.
The summary text from IMDB in a Paragraph element with an ID of "Summary".
Unordered list of three to five actors. This unorder list element should have an ID of "Actors".
All content on the page should be centered.
Color all text on the page in a contrasting color to the one you picked for the background.
Use different files for your HTML, CSS, and JS.
It is best to take this little pieces at a time, step by step, as not to get confused by too many things at once. W3 Schools is an amazing resource, and has examples on everything above if you get stuck.
Feel free to get creative and add additional features after base requirements have been met.
Publishing the app is a key requirement of the assignment.
